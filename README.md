# Boot.dev Learning Projects

This is a collection of projects I built while learning backend development through [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev).  
Each project has its own repository with code, documentation, and notes on what I learned.

These are **educational exercises** — not production apps — but they show my progression as I learned new skills and concepts.
