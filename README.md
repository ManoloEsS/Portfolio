# Boot.dev Learning Projects

</div>

This repository serves as a hub for the projects I built while learning backend development through [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev).  
These projects have increased in complexity and scope as I have acquired new skills and knowledge; they are listed in the reverse order in which I completed them.


Each project has its own repository with:
- Source code
- Documentation

These are educational exercises — not production-ready apps — but they show my progression as I learned new skills and concepts.
