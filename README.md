          # Boot.dev Learning Projects

This repository serves as a hub for the projects I built while learning backend development through [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev).  
The projects are listed in the order they were completed, and they increase in complexity and scope.

Each project has its own repository with:
- Source code
- Documentation
- Notes on what I learned from completing the project

These are educational exercises — not production-ready apps — but they show my progression as I learned new skills and concepts.
